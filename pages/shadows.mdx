# Shadows

## Box Shadows

Shadow styles can be used for components like: toasts, drawers, modals, layers, tours, tooltips, pop-outs, cards, hover interactions or focus states.

Card shadow naming convention and spread and offset logic are based off the [tachyon box shadow approach](https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/box-shadow/), with the exception of shadow 1 or card shadow.

## Shadows and mobile

In certain cases it is desirable to not display shadows on smaller devices. For these cases we can use the `.shadow-[n]-ns` (n=1->6 are available as responsive classes). When applied, these classes will automatically only render a box-shadow at device widths greater than 768px.

Similar classes are available for `m` and `l` device widths to only render a box-shadow at certain widths. The structure for these classes is:

`.shadow-[n]-[size]`

```
medium (m): 768 - 1024px
large (l): > 1024px
```
