# Borders

## Border Radius

`brad` is the shorthand we chose for border-radius and originally our design system just used a couple of values `-2` for 2px and `-4` for -4px
buttttt looking in the Tachyons search it looks like this has expanded to include a rogue 11 and some sizes like md/lg etc.

`tr` `tl` modifiers for `top-right` `top-left` respectively too

## Borders

- `b` main shorthand for border with some modifiers:
- `c` color (e.g. bc-gray)
- `w` width (e.g. bw-thick )

---

### directions can also be modifiers:

- `bb` border bottom
- `br` border right
- `bt` border top
- `bl` border left
- `bh` border horizontal

---

### so can hover states:

- `-hover` applies the border rule on hover (so `bt-hover` applies the same rules as `bt` but only on hover)
