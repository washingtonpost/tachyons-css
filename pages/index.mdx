# Tachyons

WPDS offers a global CSS framework for rapid development with our design system standards in mind! Inspired by [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) the framework is a utility class-based approach to writing minimal CSS. Check out our v0 Docs for [examples with components](https://build.washingtonpost.com/v0/design/uncategorized/accordion)!

## Usage

Import the global framework:

```
import "@washingtonpost/tachyons-css/dist/index.css";
```

Use to your heart's content ❤️:

```
